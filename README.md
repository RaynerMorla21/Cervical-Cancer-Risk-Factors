## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage Machine Learning (ML) to predict the likelihood of cervical cancer based on various patient data. Early detection of cervical cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality rates. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing demographic data, medical history, and test results, we aim to build a predictive model that assists in early diagnosis.




## The Critical Question

How accurately can we predict the likelihood of a patient developing cervical cancer using demographic data and medical history?




## Hypotheses






## Data Sources:

- Dataset: Cervical Cancer Risk Factors dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  - Link: UCI Cervical Cancer Risk Factors Dataset




## Data Wrangling, Cleaning & Manipulation

1. Data Cleaning:

   - Handled missing values.
   - Corrected data types.
   - Removed outliers.

2. Data Wrangling:
   - Formatted the data to be suitable for ML models.
